## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses real-world-like mobile usage data to:
- Understand how people in India use smartphones (apps, data, calls)
- Segment users by behavior using **ML and clustering**
- Offer actionable insights for **telecoms, marketers, manufacturers, and app developers**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🔍 Analyze mobile usage patterns across user types  
- 📊 Visualize trends in usage, recharge behavior, and device type  
- 🤖 Build ML models to classify users by **primary device use**  
- 🧠 Cluster users into behavioral segments  
- 🌐 Deploy results as an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**

## 🔍 Approach

### 🧹 Data Preparation
- Handled nulls, outliers, and inconsistent values  
- Normalized/standardized numerical features  

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- App usage patterns across age groups  
- Recharge vs usage trends  
- Popularity of OS/brands across cities  

### 🧠 Machine Learning Models
| Task          | Models Used                                 |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Classification| Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN |
| Clustering    | K-Means, DBSCAN                              |

- **Target**: Predict user’s primary phone use  
- Evaluated using: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

### 🖥️ App Interface (Streamlit)
- Upload your own CSV file  
- View usage distribution charts  
- Explore ML predictions and clusters  
- Cluster-wise feature insights

## 📊 Key Insights (Sample)

- Users under 25 spend more time on **gaming and social media**  
- **iOS users** tend to have higher recharge costs and fewer apps  
- A significant cluster of users has **low data + high call time** – ideal for voice plans  
- **XGBoost** outperformed other models in classifying primary usage type with ~89% F1-score
